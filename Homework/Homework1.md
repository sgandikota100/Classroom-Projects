# Homework 1

## Assignment
Part of this homework consisted of setting up the IDE (VS code) and connecting to the Linux Servers.

The second half had us implement a short piece of code in C followed by MIPS. The code consisted of simple arithmatic and conditional logic (my code was only 10 line)

## What I learned 
I have extensive knowedge in java, so the C portion was very straightforward. 

The MIPS portion was farily simple becuase it was only basic arithmetic followed by 1 branch condition. Still, it gave me a good idea of how each line of C was a condensed version of assembly code. My code could have been done much more efficently, but becuase this was my first try it is fairly lengthy for a simple program.
