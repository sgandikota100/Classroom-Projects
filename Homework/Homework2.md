# Homework 2

## The Assignment

The core of this homework is the following: 

"You will write a program that analyzes two timelines, each of which gives a history of major cities in which a person has lived in chronological order.  Your program will determine the earliest point in which both people were living in the same city at the same
time and report the city they had in common."

# What I learned
Once again, the C porition of the code was farily straightforward. I have taken Data Structures / Algorithms for Java and I do fairly well with problem solving in this context.

In MIPS, there were several ideas introduced that taught me a lot: 
1. Flow of Control in Loops: I learned how to control my loop by checking the conditional, jumping back to the top of the loop with the jump instruction.
2. Software Interupts (SWIs): In this class, we use SWIs to create visualizations and check our answers on a python-based MIPS32 simulator, MISASIM. I obtained expience using this to my advantage to debug code
3. Efficency: This was a lengthy piece of code. While effeciency was not considered in this assignment, it really gave me a perspective on the important of register reuse and using bitwise manipulation to optimize code
