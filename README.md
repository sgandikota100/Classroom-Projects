# ECE 2035 Portfolio

Year: Fall 2023 

## Context
  A year before I took this class, I barely knew how to code, meaning the task print "hello world" was near impossible. What was an 'IDE'? Level of programing languages? The 
compiler versus the assembler?? That semester, sure I learned the basics, but did it mean anything to me? No! But there was somthing that caught my eye in all the confusion. 
It was being able to take what I learned and applying it to cool projects. And it was through these projects where I've grown to enjoy and truly understand what I'm doing. Plus, 
it's super fun to show my non-tech savy friends what I can do! 

  Most content is copyrighted, and therefore the original code will not be posted on this repository. However, I will explain my journey through the homeworks and projects. I hope
you'll be able to see how much I've learned at the low level!

Here's a list of topics covered by the class: 

  1. Introduction to High Level Language (C) and Assembly Programing (MIPS)
  2. Processing: Intruction Set Architecture (ISA) datapath and opperations
  3. Control: understanding Conditionals (if-then-else), Iteration (while, for, do), Arrays (1-D, 2-D, 3-D), and Nonlocal control flow (continue, break, return)
  4. Supporting Data Abstraction: Storage (stack, heap, static), data types, varaible and type declarations, pointers, structs, word allignment
  5. Supporting Procedural Abstraction: Procedure calling, Stack activation frames, Parameter typing and passing, Function pointers
  6. Heap Management
  7. Data Structures
  8. Garbage Collection
  9. Compilation
