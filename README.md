# ECE Project Portfolio

Duration: Fall 2022 - Present 

## Context
  Fall 2022, I barely knew how to code, meaning the task print "hello world" was near impossible. What was an 'IDE'? Level of programing languages? The 
compiler versus the assembler?? That semester, sure I learned the basics, but did it mean anything to me? No! But there was somthing that caught my eye in all the confusion. 
It was being able to take what I learned and applying it to cool projects. And it was through these projects where I've grown to enjoy and truly understand what I'm doing. Plus, 
it's super fun to show my non-tech savy friends what I can do! 

## Projects
- CS 20340: Hangman, Yahtzee, and Connect Four
- ECE 2035: Find George and los gatos
