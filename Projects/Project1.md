# Project 1 

## The Assignment
"This project focuses on a constrained search problem: finding an exact match pattern, variably
scaled in an image array (such as a specific face or pose that appears within a crowd scene). In
this assignment, we will focus on finding George P. Burdell, whose mugshot is shown in Figure
1, in an image that contains a crowd of faces, such as the sample scene in Figure 2. The faces in
the scene, including George's, may be at varying distances from the camera, so they may appear
scaled."
