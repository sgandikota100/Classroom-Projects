# MBED Video Game 

Class: ECE 2035 

Year: Fall 2023

## The Assignment 
In this assignment, I was tasked to build an adventuraous game on an mbed microcontroller (specifically mbed NXP LPC1768). While the basic 
outline of the game was given, I was given creative control on how that game should be implemented. The core of the game is a hashmap that 
hold the list of all objects on the map (so the object's location is the key). Additional classes build on this functionality or add 
additional graphics for the game itself (such as all the icons, the menus, and the speech bubbles).

## What I learned 
With prior exposure to hashmaps (in the data structures and algorithms class), I had a good idea on how hashmaps work. The game was 
programed in C, so I now have a much more thorough understanding of the `malloc()` and `free()` functions. Now, the project itself felt 
much more overwhelming initially becuase I was kind of thrown into a lot of skeleton code that was very interconnectd. Being a very 
massive project(estimating around 10,000 lines of code where I wrote at least 5,000 lines), I learned a lot about project management
and have a more "object oriented" approach. 

The biggest challenge I overcame was the creativity in dealing with some of the graphics: how do I create simple animations when an enemy
is defeated or when I am creating transitions in speech bubbles. Overall however, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining project. As 
you can probably tell, I had a lot of fun designing and implementing "los gatos".
